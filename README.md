## Inspiration üí°
There are many productivity apps online but because of too many non-essential features, it can be sometimes ugly. I always wanted to make my own note taking app which has a minimal aesthetic and is easy to use on the first go without having to go through a big manual of information. I hope this app can help students like me to manage their school life with some ease. ‚ô•
